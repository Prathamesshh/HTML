        <p> Entrepreneurship is the process of developing, organizing, and running a new business to generate profit while taking on financial risk. 
            In a broader sense, entrepreneurship is the process of transforming the status quo by solving the most pressing problems and pain points in our society, often by introducing an innovative product or service or creating new markets.
            An entrepreneur is someone who has an idea and who works to create a product or service that people will buy, as well as an organization to support that effort. 
            An entrepreneur takes on most of the risk and initiative for their new business, and is often seen as a visionary or innovator.
